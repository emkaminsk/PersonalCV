### ⚠️ ISSUE FOUND: Education Date Conflict

**Problem**: University of Economics Master's degree shows same dates as Postgraduate (November 2016 - June 2017)

**Analysis**:
- Postgraduate (Data warehouses) typically comes AFTER a Master's degree
- Master's degree should have earlier dates
- Typical Master's programs in Poland: 2001-2005 timeframe (before starting work in 2005)

**Recommended Action**: Verify correct dates for University of Economics Master's degree with user
